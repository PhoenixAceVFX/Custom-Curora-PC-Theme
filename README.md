# Aroma White  

This is a custom theme for PowerCord that I currently Maintain myself  
I do not claim credit for any of the code as this is a mash of many snips from the PowerCord Discord  
You can toggle individual aftermods in the Aroma.css  
Yes I know that the server list isn't themed that is intentional, I like it that way but I might make a mod to fix that for people who dont  
Just use this in your cmd to download it (make sure your in your powercord themes folder)  

git clone https://github.com/PhoenixAceVFX/Aroma-White  

# THEME IS COMPATABLE WITH BETTERDISCORD  
I have made Aroma.theme.css so that BetterDiscord users can use this theme as it is fully compatible (Powercord based features wont work)  
Do enjoy the theme I am maintaining
