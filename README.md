# Aroma White  

This is a custom theme for PowerCord that I currently Maintain myself  

I do not claim credit for any of the code as this is a mash of many snips from the PowerCord Discord  

You can toggle individual aftermods in the Aroma.css  

Just use this in your cmd to download it (make sure your in your powercord themes folder)  

git clone https://github.com/PhoenixAceVFX/Aroma-White  

# THEME IS COMPATABLE WITH BETTERDISCORD  
You have to put the code from the CSS in "Custom CSS" for it to work (No im not adding meta to make it easier for you)  
There will be compat issues due to differing modals but it mostly works
